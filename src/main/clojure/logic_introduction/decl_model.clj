;; Semantics

;; Two ways to look at a piece of functionality:
;;
;; Logical view: statement of logic
;; Operational view: execution on a computer

;; # Example with Functional Programming
;; ## Logical semantics
;;
;; Return value is a appended to b
;;
;; ## Operational semantics
;;
;; If a is empty, return b, otherwise return rest of a
;; appended to the cons of first of a and b.

(defn append [a b]
  (match [a b]
         [[] _] b
         [[x & as] _] (cons x (append as b))))

;; # Eliminate return value
;;
;; Formal logic is normally expressed in terms of variables. This does
;; not map well to the notion of "returning" a value.
;;
;; Convert the return value to a parameter "c" ..
;;
;; (defn append [a b c]
;;    ...)
;;
;; and we can express the Logical Semantics more correctly:
;;
;; c is a appended to b


;; # Directionality
;;
;; In functional programming "return values" are for output
;; and parameters are for "input"
;;
;; To play the role of the return value, we need an "output" parameter.


;; # Output Parameter?
;;
;; The caller of the function should initialize some sort
;; of variable and pass this to the function. After execution
;; we should expect the variable to be changed.
;;
;; Variables should be "bind-once" after being initialized to unbound.
;; 
;; Much safer than "output" parameters with pointers in C, instead bind-once
;; with immutable values. Similar concept.



;; # Dataflow variable
;; 
;; For educational purposes only ..
;;
;; Bind-once semantics.
;;
;; See implementation


;; # Shape
;;
;; Computation has a different shape using output parameters
;;
;; (let [x (logic-variable)]
;;   (append [1] [2] x)
;;   @x)
;; ;=> [1 2]
;; 
;; Feels like abstracting away assignment


;; # Collecting results
;;
;; Abstract this pattern with "solve-logic-variable". Implementation above.
;;
;; (solve-logic-variable [x]
;;   (append [1] [2] x))
;; ;=> [1 2]
;;
;; Returns the value of logic-variable variable x after executing body.


;; # Patterns of input/output arguments
;;
;; From the logical semantics of "append", we can deduce 
;; some interesting relationships
;;
;; If c is a appended to b
;; then a should be everything in c before b
;;
;; If c is a appended to b
;; then b should be everything in c after a

;; Nondeterministic LP:
;; - more flexible operational semantics
;;
;; This is core.logic, an implementation of minikanren.

;; Instead of "logic-variable" variables we have "logic variables", which are initialized
